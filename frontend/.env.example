# API URL for the backend
#
# DEVELOPMENT (default behavior):
#   Leave empty or unset - defaults to http://localhost:8000/api
#   This is intentionally safe: fresh dev setups never hit production.
#
# PRODUCTION:
#   Set to your backend URL including /api path
#   Example: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com/api
#
# See lib/api.ts for validation and fallback behavior.
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=
